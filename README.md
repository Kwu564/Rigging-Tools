A python addon for blender that contains a collection of useful tools for rigging such as creating bone chains along several objects or verts, a way to straigten a chain along an axis as well as a way to generate a spine rig. Located under Rigging Tools in the tools tab. Note that some operations may be confusing to use without looking at the code. I originally programmed these tools for my use only (Sorry!).
